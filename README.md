# constitution
UK needs a clear and written constitution. Let's make one together!


The proposal is that the UK has a mandatory nationwide citizens social media network like Twitter. 

Social collective governance system – power pyramid

Objective

This is a system based on principles and ideas found in social networking that allows for the governance of anything from a one off task to the ongoing running of a country's institutions, army and even the government itself. 

Testing

To test this system we should start with a one off task (i'd suggest something involving logistics, funding and tech.) and see how things play out, then look to see if it would scale. I suggest a task that those we involve at the start would be interested in, an experiment, to see how it works in practice.

Members and goal groups

A group would look like this it terms of structure

            A – (leader, leader group)
          B B
       CC  CC
    DDD  DDD    

So B's follow A, C's follow B's, D's follow C's and so on, you can increase the hight, width and max followers per member but consider that everyone needs to feel they have influence. It's critical that lower members must follow orders from those above, if you don't like the orders just unfollow and your out or follow someone you're better aligned with, anyway everyone gets to vote on the goal spec/constitution

Members of each goal group are the same 

Does not matter the qualifications of people involved just their ability to get things done, successful execution is the goal not stroking egos 

The identification system

This is a separate project but basically a simple SSI (self sovereign identity) system

Rapid leadership rotation and obfuscation

Members are held in place by their follower count (that includes all those below them in their pyramid), if they lose followers they lose their position, also members can volunteer to move/rotate/swap to obfuscate leadership, for example a goal might require different leaders at different times because of different leaders abilities. The whole idea here is to maintain competition and not allow consolidation of power but make things more inclusive by keeping those lower down very much involved in control and feedback

Top down recruitment and verification

Distribution of funding
